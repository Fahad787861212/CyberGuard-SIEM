# CyberGuard SIEM Solution

## Overview

Welcome to the CyberGuard SIEM Solution repository! This project is part of a specialized initiative I've undertaken as a cybersecurity enthusiast aiming to develop a robust Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system. 

### What is SIEM?

A Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system provides real-time analysis of security alerts generated by hardware and software.

This project focuses on using Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK Stack) to provide a custom SIEM solution. The solution includes features like log collection, vulnerability detection, and compliance monitoring, built with a Python-based security agent.

### Code Overview

The core of the project is the **`elasticsearch_siem.py`** file, which controls various operations of the SIEM, such as connecting to Elasticsearch, starting and stopping Logstash, and handling the parsing of logs. Key features include:

- **Elasticsearch Connection Management:** Handling the connection to an Elasticsearch instance for log indexing and search operations.
- **Logstash Integration:** The ability to start and stop Logstash with specified configuration files, allowing efficient log parsing.
- **Index and Query Management:** Functions to create, list, and delete indices on Elasticsearch and query logs for detailed analysis.
- **Field Extraction and Log Parsing:** Extraction of key information from various log types (System, Application, Security) to enable deeper analysis and processing of logs.

## Skills and Experience Gained

Working on this project has provided me with hands-on experience in several key areas of cybersecurity and system management:

- **System Architecture Design**: Learned about designing scalable systems that can handle large volumes of data efficiently.
- **ELK Stack Configuration:** I configured Elasticsearch for log storage, Logstash for parsing, and Beats for data shipping. Iâ€™ve become proficient in managing and running these tools on Windows systems.
- **Creating and Running Config Files:** I gained extensive experience writing and maintaining configuration files, especially for Logstash, to enable effective log parsing and analysis.
- **Data Analytics**: Gained insights into the processing and analysis of big data, learning how to derive meaningful insights from raw data.

## ELK Stack Configuration and Logstash Setup

### **ELK Stack**

- **Elasticsearch:** Configured as the backend for storing and querying logs, Elasticsearch is used for fast data retrieval and analysis.
- **Kibana:** Provides a web interface for visualizing log data and tracking security incidents.
- **Logstash:** Processes logs and forwards them to Elasticsearch for indexing. The configurations ensure that various log types are parsed effectively.

### **Logstash Configuration**

I have put significant effort into creating a robust Logstash configuration file that efficiently parses logs and sends them to Elasticsearch for indexing. The current configuration supports parsing logs from multiple sources and extracting key fields that provide insights into system performance and security status.

### **Current Status and Future Work**

The work on the Logstash configuration file is still ongoing, with plans for further improvement. A more comprehensive and optimized version is under development, which will include:

- **Enhanced Log Parsing:** Improving the extraction of fields and log normalization for more detailed analysis.
- **Custom Pipelines:** Implementing specific pipelines to process logs based on their type and severity.
- **Additional Processing**: Performing further processing after extraction of logs from database.
- **Rules and Alerts:** Setting up rules according to certain conditions and thresholds that would generate alerts.
